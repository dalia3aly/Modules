      <h4>What Best Describes You?</h4>
      <div id=div01 style="padding:80px; background-color: rgb(255, 95, 95); font-size: large; display: inline-block;"> Extrovert </div>
      <div id=div02 style="padding:80px; background-color: rgb(255, 176, 119); font-size: large; display: inline-block;"> Ambivert </div>
      <div id=div03 style="padding:80px; background-color: rgb(255, 231, 134); font-size: large; display: inline-block;"> Introvert </div>
      <pre>Extroverts are those who enjoy being around other people. 
        They have a strong need to socialize and talk to others.</pre>
      <pre>Introverts feel more comfortable focusing on their inner thoughts and ideas,
        rather than what's happening externally.
        They enjoy spending time with just one or two people, rather than large groups or crowds.</pre>
      <pre>Ambiverts exhibit qualities of both introversion and extroversion,
        and can flip into either depending on their mood, context, and goals. 
        Ambiverts have also been called: Outgoing introverts</pre>

        <p>This is a paragraph about personalities</p>
        <pre>
          This is about how the world seems to be designed for some types of personality and descriminates against the others. 
          Here's a wish for this to change one day and also some world peace wishes dadadada
        </pre>

          <h4>What people may think:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>I Agree, Let's change the world!</li>
          <h6>OR</h6>
          <li>I disagree, the world is fair the way it is!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>If you belong to the first group, your argument could be: </h4>
        <ol>
          <li>I agree based on my personal experience</li>
          <li>I'm an introvert, and I was denied some privileges that others could possess</li>
          <li>I'm an extrovert, and I think my need to socialise more left me with less time to focus on myself</li>
        </ol>
